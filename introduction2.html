   <h1> <b>Introduce Myself</b> </h1>

<h2>Hello, My name is Carol Chang. I have hearing loss in both ears and am a little bit autistic. </h2> 

<h2>I took ITD 110 before and learned how to use  HTML and CSS. I like to create web pages with movies and love art because  I watch animated or real live CGI cartoon film images a lot and read manga and painting portraits, such as canvas and art studio.</h2>

<h2>I am very interested in creating a website showing colorful images with bright landscape background. I am fascinated by the infinite color palette and anxious to create a world of my own through my paintings. The life experiences with my artworks on my webpage will be creative and have a great potential to piece together colors and shapes that are not conventionally used in the illustration is natural.</h2>

<h2>I cherish every art piece to open a view of my interactions with the world. The various forms of sensory impairments and handicaps make a space for my natural talent of viewing the world with colorful visual effects. From this position, my great inspiration is to paint the world with my own spirit in a deep sense of nature.</h2></p>

<h2>Most recently I am painting artwork to embrace my vibrancy and unusual methods of using colors.
â€¨Here is my painted canvas show on my site I had four top artworks linked with very brief detailed sources of clicking images("Boy and His Tiger", "Lonely Cow", "Yawning Fox", and "Magic Fairy Kingdom Palace", part favorite art subject.)</h2>
