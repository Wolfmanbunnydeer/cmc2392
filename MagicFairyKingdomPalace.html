<p>The artwork Magic Fairy Kingdom Palace is anything occasional place enjoyed nature. This artwork is used in Gimp, an art studio that produces more vibrant color and brush techniques on art software instead of using a real canvas. </p>
<p>The artwork is loosely based on the holiday mostly Christmas on a mysterious island of a magical palace floating on water. </p>
<p> There are three figures the bubble blower boy, tiger cub (below) and the active orangutan in the marble castle house went together on vacation.
</p>
<p>By the way the tiger cub on the bottom of the floor enjoyed watching and playing with bubbles.
